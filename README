Description: 
A python utility for generating Verilog 2001 files for interface definitions. 

Motivation: 
One of the great shortcomings of Verilog 2001 is its lack of a generic interface
feature--if a connection is added between two submodules in a hierarchy, it
requires modifying every level of the connection. This utility provides a simple
remedy to this problem by autogenerating collection of verilog modules and header
files which fully describe and encapsulate the interface. 

Interface definitions: 
An interface <ifname> is defined in a JSON file: <ifname>.json. 

Usage:

Data Products: 
The utility produces three verilog files
<ifname>_inc.v     - localparams for component width and position
<ifname>_fan_in.v  - instantiate this module at the point of composition                         
<ifname>_fan_out.v - instantiate this module at the point of decomposition
